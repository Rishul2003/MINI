# Malware Detection Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project that demonstrates malware detection of Portable Executable (PE) files and URLs using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes various algorithms to achieve high accuracy in identifying malware.

## Overview

### PE File Detection

For PE file detection, the following machine learning algorithms were used:

- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression

The model with the best accuracy was selected for deployment. The accuracy achieved for PE file detection is **99.4%**.

### URL Detection

For URL detection, Logistic Regression was used, achieving an accuracy of **98.76%**.

## Features

- High accuracy in detecting malware in PE files and URLs
- Comparison of multiple algorithms to select the best model for PE file detection
- Comparison with existing research for performance benchmarking
- Easy to use and integrate with other systems

## Comparison with Research

Our results were compared with the findings from the research paper "[Efficient malware detection in PE files using machine learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9117547)" published in IEEE. The comparison shows that our approach provides competitive accuracy rates, demonstrating the effectiveness of the selected machine learning models.
